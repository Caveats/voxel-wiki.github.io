On this page anybody can add projects involving voxels (even their own!), just edit the [`projects.toml` file](https://github.com/voxel-wiki/voxel-wiki.github.io/blob/main/content/wiki/projects.toml) and create a [pull-request/issue](https://github.com/voxel-wiki/voxel-wiki.github.io/issues)!

**Note:** Unless a project is `Released`, it's state may not be accurate.

<!-- Project table data can be found in the "content/wiki/projects.toml"-file next to this file. -->
